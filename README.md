# Predict-Flight-Delay
This project is built using R and leverages Machine Learning techniques to predict flight delays. It also evaluates various models to determine the one that yields the highest prediction accuracy.

Due to the size and complexity of the dataset (CSV file), it is recommended to have at least 12 GB of free RAM available for efficient data processing and analysis.
